In the Biodiversity Exploratores, vegetation surveys have been conducted twice per year from 2009-2020 (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/30909). Additionally, forest management intensitiy has been measured as the Proportion of non-natural tree species, Proportion of harvested tree biomass and Proportion of dead wood showing signs of saw cuts (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24646). Detailed information can be found in the meta data description of both data sets (see link).

Your task:

Your task is to compare the number of species between the three regions (S - Schorfheide, H - Hainich and A - Swabian Alb) and to visualize this comparison. Additionally, you are asked to visualize the relationship between the number of species and the three measurements of forest management intensity. Both of these task shall be done for one selected year

- Download the data provided in the Ilias-folder "Project 1"
- Look up which year you've been assigned to in the table "Year-assigned" in the Project 1 folder.
- Create a project folder which you share
