*This marked assignment must be submitted by 9th of June 2025.*

In the Biodiversity Exploratores, data on temperature was collected on 300 plots. Half of those are in grasslands, the other half in forests. 
You will calculate monthly temperature deviations in 2024 for different plots compared to the overall monthly average from 2015 to 2025. Additionally, you'll explore whether land cover type (forest vs. grassland) appears to influence these deviations. Use a fitting plot to show those differences. Prepare your project in a way that it is sharable with everybody.

Have a look in Ilias to see which plots were assigned to you.

```
Deviation (plot, month) = AvgTemp (plot, month, 2024) − OverallAvgTemp (month, 2015–2025)
```

<!--
In the Biodiversity Exploratores, vegetation surveys have been conducted twice per year from 2009-2020 (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/30909). 

Additionally, forest management intensitiy has been measured as the Proportion of non-natural tree species, Proportion of harvested tree biomass and Proportion of dead wood showing signs of saw cuts (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24646). Detailed information can be found in the meta data description of both data sets (see link).

Your task:

Your task is to compare the number of species between the three regions (S - Schorfheide, H - Hainich and A - Swabian Alb) and to visualize this comparison. Additionally, you are asked to visualize the relationship between the number of species and the three measurements of forest management intensity. Both of these task shall be done for **one selected year of plant data**.

- Download the data provided in the Ilias-folder "Project 1"
- Look up which year you've been assigned to in the table "Year-assigned" in the Project 1 folder. 
- Create a project folder which you share

*Tip: In the timespan covered, there were two inventories of the stand (harvested tree biomass and proportion of non-natural tree species) and dead wood, respectively. Especially the former is quite time consuming and not all plots of a region could be assessed in one year. Think of an appropriate way how to deal with that and describe it in your project*
