1.  
- Read in the "Trends.csv". Use both "if else" and "ifelse" to print out the text "percentages lost" or "percentages won" when the CDU/CSU lost or won votes from the last period to the new elections.
- Now create a third category, called "stable", which comprises all changes which are fewer than 5% lost or won Again, print the text.
- Now print whether there were trend changes, i.e. when the party has lost from period 2014-2019 to 2019-2024 but increased afterwards, print "recovery", else, if the trend was positive, but changed to negative, print "hard losses", if the trend -be it negative or positive- was stable, print "no change"

2. Use a for loop to ask this for all parties. Create a new data frame, where you print for every party which has data for all the years the trend in a column.
