1) Load the two datasets "specdat" and "envdat" into your environment. Name them accordingly as "specdat" and "envdat".   
  
2) Transform "specdat" into a long format (named "speclong") so that the species (columns from the third column onwards) are in one column, and the corresponding coverage degrees are in a column named "CoverageDegrees".  
  
3) Calculate the mean, sum, and standard deviation per plot.  
  
4) Repetition of Assignment 04: Merge "speclong" with "envdat" into "mergedat" without any information loss ;).
