1. a) Load the two datasets "specdat" and "envdat" into your environment. Name them accordingly as "specdat" and "envdat".
   b) Transform "specdat" into a long format (named "speclong") so that the species (columns from the third column onwards) are in one column, and the corresponding coverage degrees are in a column named "CoverageDegrees".
   c) Calculate the mean, sum, and standard deviation per plot.
   d) Repetition of Assignment 04: Merge "speclong" with "envdat" into "mergedat" without any information loss ;).
