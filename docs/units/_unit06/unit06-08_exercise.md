3. <br/>
    a) Create a project folder. Download and extract the .zip file "DataDay04" into this folder.<br/>
    b) Download and load the "vegan" package.<br/>
    c) Load the two datasets "specdat" and "envdat" into your environment. Name them accordingly as "specdat" and "envdat".<br/>
    d) Transform "specdat" into a long format (named "speclong") so that the species (columns from the third column onwards) are in one column, and the corresponding coverage degrees are in a column named "CoverageDegrees".<br/>
    e) Calculate the mean, sum, and standard deviation per plot.

2. Merge "speclong" with "envdat" into "mergedat".
