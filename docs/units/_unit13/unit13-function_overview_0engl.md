| **Category**           | **Function**       | **Input Type**                   | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Considerations**                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reading Data**       | `read.csv`        | File path (character string)     | Reads a CSV file into a data frame.                                            | Ensure the file path is correct. Handles text encoding issues and can set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to avoid unexpected factor conversion.                   |
|                        | `read.table`      | File path (character string)     | Reads a table into a data frame.                                               | Offers flexibility for delimiter-separated files but requires manual settings like `sep` for delimiters and `header` for column names.                        |
| **Simple Math**        | `sum`             | Numeric vector                   | Calculates the sum of vector elements.                                         | Watch out for `NA` values; use `na.rm = TRUE` to ignore missing data.                                                                                          |
|                        | `mean`            | Numeric vector                   | Computes the mean (average) of vector elements.                                | Default behavior includes `NA` values unless `na.rm = TRUE` is specified.                                                                                     |
|                        | `round`           | Numeric vector                   | Rounds numeric values to a specified number of decimal places.                 | Rounding can introduce numerical bias; use carefully when precision matters.                                                                                   |
|                        | `log`             | Numeric vector                   | Calculates the natural logarithm of values.                                    | Check input for non-positive values, as the logarithm is undefined for these.                                                                                  |
| **Indexing**           | `[]`               | Vector, matrix, or data frame    | Extracts elements of vectors, matrices, or data frames.                        | Indices are 1-based in R. Use logical, numeric, or character indices carefully to avoid errors.                                                                |
| **Subsetting**         | `subset`          | Data frame                       | Returns subsets of data frames based on conditions.                            | Simpler than using `[`, but can be slower for large datasets.                                                                                                  |
| **Sorting**            | `sort`            | Vector                           | Sorts vector elements in ascending or descending order.                        | Handles `NA` values by default. Can specify `decreasing = TRUE` for descending order.                                                                          |
|                        | `order`           | Vector                           | Returns indices to sort data in ascending or descending order.                 | Often used to sort data frames by multiple columns.                                                                                                            |
|                        | `rank`            | Vector                           | Returns the ranks of elements in a vector.                                     | Be cautious with ties; the `ties.method` argument determines tie-breaking behavior.                                                                            |
| **Selecting Data**     | `which`           | Logical vector                   | Returns indices of elements that meet a condition.                             | Works with logical conditions; helpful for subsetting data programmatically.                                                                                   |
|                        | `match`           | Vector x, Vector y               | Finds matches of elements in one vector within another.                        | Returns indices of matches; may return `NA` for unmatched elements.                                                                                           |
|                        | `%in%`            | Vector x, Vector y               | Logical operator to test if elements belong to another vector.                 | Easier than `match` for boolean results but does not return indices.                                                                                           |
| **Writing Data**       | `write.csv`       | Data frame                       | Writes a data frame to a CSV file.                                             | Check path and permissions. May require `row.names = FALSE` to avoid writing row indices.                                                                      |
|                        | `write.table`     | Data frame or matrix             | Writes a data frame or matrix to a table file.                                 | Use `sep` to specify delimiter. Be careful with special characters in data.                                                                                    |
| **Aggregating Data**   | `aggregate`       | Data frame                       | Splits data into groups and applies functions to summarize them.               | Useful for simple aggregation but limited for complex tasks. Grouping variables should be carefully selected.                                                  |
|                        | `tapply`          | Vector x, Factor                 | Applies a function to subsets of a vector based on a factor.                   | Great for 1D aggregation; for multidimensional aggregation, consider alternatives.                                                                             |
| **Merging Data**       | `merge`           | Data frame x, Data frame y       | Combines data frames by columns or rows based on shared keys.                  | Specify `by` to avoid unexpected joins. Handles one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.                                                       |
|                        | `cbind`           | Vectors or data frames           | Combines objects by columns.                                                   | Objects must have matching row dimensions. Risk of mismatched data if row orders differ.                                                                       |
|                        | `rbind`           | Vectors or data frames           | Combines objects by rows.                                                      | Objects must have matching column dimensions. Missing values can cause errors.                                                                                 |
| **Plotting**           | `plot`            | x: Numeric vector, y: Numeric vector | Creates a scatterplot or line plot depending on the inputs.                    | Highly customizable. Use `type`, `col`, `pch`, and `main` for customization.                                                                                   |
|                        | `hist`            | Numeric vector                   | Creates a histogram to display the distribution of data.                       | Use `breaks` to control bin size. Labels and axis scaling may need adjustment for clarity.                                                                     |
