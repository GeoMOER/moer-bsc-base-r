1. Download the .rds file "Day3_Task1" from "Collected Works". Do this only as a last resort. When you click on the folder icon in your Environment and navigate to this file, you can load the `Emission_per_Country` dataset into your workspace. <br/>
    a) How many countries are there in total in the dataset? <br/>
    b) How many countries appear more than once?<br/>
    c) Which countries produced more emissions in 2021 than the average? Note: at this point, we ignore that some countries appear twice and thus are counted twice in the calculation - that's a topic for another day.<br/>
    d) Which country's emissions have reduced more from 1990 to 2021 than the median change?<br/>
    e) Sort the dataset by emissions in 2020. Which country has the third-largest emissions?<br/>
    f) Name two variants that could be used to filter the data into a new data set called "relSmall", which only contains the countries that emitted less than the average (arothmetic mean).

Please save your file as “FirstName_LastName_Task_Day3_Unit04.R”.
