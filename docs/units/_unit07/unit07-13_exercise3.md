2)  a dotplot depicting the average temperature of year 2009 per plot

3)  a barplot of the number of sampled plots in june in per year

4)  a boxplot of temperatures, measured as monthly means, showing the contrast between grasland and forest for 2009

5)  a linechart depicting the temperature along datetime for plot AEW10

6)  a scatterplot depicting the temperatures per plot along datetime in 2024
