Consider the following plot:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u07/examplePlot.png" %}

Try to recreate this plot.

Useful tips for arranging plots can be found here: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/arranging-plots-with-par-mfrow-and-layout.html

You can save the plot later by running png("Output/Scatterplot_Boxplot.png") before your plot command and executing dev.off() after you have executed your plot command. Do this only when you are satisfied with your plot.
