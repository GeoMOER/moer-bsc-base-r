## Part 1
1. - Copy the following lines:
      ```
      df1 <- data.frame(X = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Y = c(10, 12, 8, 15, 20))
      df2 <- data.frame(X = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Y = c(5, 8, 10, 12, 15))
      df3 <- data.frame(X = c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7), Y = c(8, 10, 12, 15, 18))
      ```
   - Create a list from these lines.
   - Use this list to generate a loop that plots X against Y for each dataset.
   - Color the points red if the sum of X is greater than 20.

## Part2
Background: Within the project "Nature 4.0", an "Automated Moth Trap" (AMT) was tested, which attracts moths using UV light and photographs them at regular intervals. Ideally, the resulting images are analyzed by AI, which requires considerable training. The annotations (bounding boxes) made by the AI are stored in .yaml files. 

Engage in teams (online and offline group - see Ilias) with your respective code snippets and try to answer the respective questions. Present the code snippet and it's functionality to the class afterwards.
