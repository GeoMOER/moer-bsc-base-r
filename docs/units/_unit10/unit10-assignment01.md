# 1. Creating vectors
Choose your favorite book, movie, or game as a theme. Based on this theme, create three vectors (vec1, vec2, and vec3) of different data types (e.g., numeric, character, logical). Each vector should contain at least 5 elements.

# 2. working with other object types
After reading Unit 02, perform the following tasks:

Matrix: Try to create a matrix using one of the vectors you created earlier.
Dataframe: Combine all three vectors (vec1, vec2, vec3) into a dataframe.
List: Create a list that contains all three vectors.

If something does not work on the first try, document all the steps you took, including any trial and error, so that you can reflect on the process.
