1.) Please download the Project (Ilias-> Data -> "Microclimate-landuse") which was developed in parts together in the course based on the ([Example in "good practices"](/moer-bsc-base-r/unit12/unit12-good_practices_0engl.html)).  

2.) Open the project and locate the script titled 'microclimate_datacleaning.' In the section '1. Read in data + data checks,' conduct any additional data checks (e.g., handling missing values, identifying outliers) or make changes you deem necessary. Describe all changes and their rationale in the README.txt file.  

3.) Determine the observation level for your analysis (e.g., per plot, per year, certain months). Select one combination from the possible options: PlotID/year/month/day. Your choice will be used for the t-test analysis shown in '4. Analysis.' There are no right or wrong choices; just document your decision in the README.txt file and explain why you chose that level of observation.  

4.) Based on your chosen observation level, transform or summarize your Ta_10 data as needed to prepare it for the t-test analysis. The analysis will be done together in the next meeting.

5.) What information is missing in order to do the analysis? Any idea where to get that? Please add your answer at the beginning of your README-file.

6.) Upload your whole project as a .zip
