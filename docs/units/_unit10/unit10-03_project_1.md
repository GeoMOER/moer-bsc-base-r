## Project 1: EU Votes

Imagine you have been hired as a data analyst for a research institute focusing on European political studies. The institute plans to conduct an analysis of links between socioeconomic developments of the different EU countries and their effects on the respective seats in the European Parliament's composition and its evolution over time. Your task is to prepare the raw data on the parliamentary seats, gender balance among members, and voter turnout for one particular country across different periods. Your goal is to clean, transform, and visualize this data. Further, you have to document the process of preparation and visualization.



### Objectives

- Prepare the data.  
- Plot trends in seats per party (European level!), gender balance, and voter turnout over time/per election period.  
- Prepare a report documenting the data preparation and visualization process.  


Please refer to the project guidelines for detailed instructions and criteria for evaluation.
