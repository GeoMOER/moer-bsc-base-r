general information
<!--more-->

The unmarked assignments are primarily for me to evaluate whether anyone is facing difficulties with the course material. I expect everyone to invest time and effort into completing these tasks (as outlined in the expected workload), and all assignments should be submitted by Wednesday in the corresponding Ilias-folder.

You are encouraged to seek help via the internet as you work through the problems. However, if you are unable to find a solution, please document your thought process, any potential errors you encountered, and what you believe the issue might be. Additionally, include any specific questions you have about the code. This will help me understand where you may need further clarification.
Please always add your full name to your assignments, e.g. “Assignment01_Heidrich_Lea”. This makes it easier for the course instructors to match the uploaded assignments to the students. If it can’t be matched, it won’t be considered.

I look forward to seeing your progress!
