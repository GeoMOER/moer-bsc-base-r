Task 1: Indexing Vectors by Position and Condition
a) Create a vector vec1 with the following numeric values: c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100).
b) Access the 4th element of vec1.
c) Extract all values from vec1 that are greater than 50.
d) Create a new vector vec2 that consists of all elements from vec1 that are less than or equal to 30.

Task 2: Indexing Dataframes by Row, Column, and Condition
a) Create a dataframe df with two columns: Age (values: 25, 30, 45, 60, 75) and Height (values: 170, 165, 180, 155, 160).
b) Access the value in the 3rd row and 2nd column of df.
c) Extract all rows where the Age is greater than 40.
d) Extract all rows where the Height is less than or equal to 165.

Task 3: Indexing Matrices by Row, Column, and Condition
a) Create a matrix mat with values from 1 to 20, arranged in 5 rows and 4 columns.
b) Access the element in the 2nd row, 3rd column of mat.
c) Extract the entire 4th row from the matrix.
d) Extract all elements from mat that are greater than 10.

Task 4: Indexing Lists by Position and Condition
a) Create a list my_list containing the following elements:

A vector vec with values c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25).
A matrix mat with values from 1 to 9, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns.
A dataframe df with two columns: A = c(1, 2, 3), B = c(4, 5, 6).
b) Access the 2nd element of the vector inside the list.
c) Extract the element in the 3rd row, 1st column of the matrix inside the list.
d) Extract all rows from the dataframe inside the list where the A column is greater than 1.

Task 5: Indexing Multiple Elements by Condition
a) Create a vector temps with temperature values: c(12, 15, 10, 22, 18, 25, 30).
b) Extract all temperature values that are less than or equal to 20.
c) Create a dataframe weather with two columns: Temperature = temps and Rainfall = c(5, 10, 0, 20, 12, 30, 7). Extract all rows where the Temperature is above 18 and Rainfall is below 15.
