During the course, you are encouraged to use every freely available ressource besides the information provided here. Nevertheless, you might end up in a "dead end" or have questions regarding the course organization.
The HTML learning environment has a FAQ page for recurring questions and a comment functionality on the first page of each unit - it needs to be used to be of use, so do not hesitate to ask. There's no such thing as a stupid question.
