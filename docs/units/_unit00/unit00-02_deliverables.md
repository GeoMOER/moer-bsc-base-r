## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter are marked.
Students will need to deliver unmarked assignments in form of coding exercises on a regular basis within one week. The majority of these exercises will be worked on during the course, but if you do not complete them, you must do so by the end of the following Wednesday. 

You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar AIs to solve the assignments. However, you need to present your solution to make sure you understand what you have done.

You'll also be asked to read the new unit and take the quiz on the new units by Wednesday. Don't worry, they won't be part of your grade - it's just a tool to see if there are any general problems with understanding.

## Final grade
Your final grade will consist of the marked assignments and the MOHA.
You may use the following lines of code for calculating your final grade, for example:

```r
assignment_1 <- 5
assignment_2 <- 6
assignment_3 <- 8

final_grade <- round(mean(c(assignment_1, assignment_2, assignment_3)))
final_grade
```

Note that you do not have to achieve five points in each assignment.
However, passing the course requires at least five points in regard to your final grade and submitting the unmarked assignments in time.
