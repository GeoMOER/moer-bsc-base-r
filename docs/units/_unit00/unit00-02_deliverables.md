## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter are marked.
Students will need to deliver unmarked assignments on a regular basis ("homework") within one week. 
The submissions generally encompass R or R markdown.
You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar AIs to solve the assignments. 
However, you need to present your solution to make sure you understand what you have done.

Be aware that it will NOT be sufficient to start working on the assignments the day before the deadline.
It will be necessary to solve a lot of disturbing and time-consuming problems in the programming world.
So start early!!!

## Final grade
Your final grade will consist of the marked assignments and the MOHA.
You may use the following lines of code for calculating your final grade, for example:

```r
assignment_1 <- 5
assignment_2 <- 6
assignment_3 <- 8

final_grade <- round(mean(c(assignment_1, assignment_2, assignment_3)))
final_grade
```

Note that you do not have to achieve five points in each assignment.
However, passing the course requires at least five points in regard to your final grade and submitting the unmarked assignments in time.
