In this exercise, we'll start with the basics of R, focusing on installation and fundamental arithmetic operations. But first we need to install R and RStudio.


1. Please follow the instructions at [Course Unit 01: Installation](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/unit01/unit01-02_Installation.html) and install both R and RStudio.

2. Use R to <br/>
  a) calculate the sum and product of the numbers 3, 7, 9, 12, and 21. Explore R's help features to find an alternative solutions. <br/>
  b) Calculate the square root of 2025.

Please save your file as "FirstName_LastName_Task_Day1_Unit01.R" and upload it to the "Upload/2024-04-19"-Folder in Ilias

3. Then <br/>
  a) calculate the Shannon Index for a community of 4 species (A, B, C, D), where species A has 30 individuals, species B has 25 individuals, species C has 15 individuals, and species D has 10 individuals. The Shannon Index is calculated as follows: <br/>
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?H=-\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i\ln(p_i)"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?p_i=\frac{n_i}{N}"/> <br/>
  where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?n_i\;"> is the frequency of each species and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?N\;"/> is the total number of individuals across all species. Compare this with a community of 4 species, each having 12 individuals.<br/>
  b) compare the result with a community of 4 species, each having 22 individuals.
